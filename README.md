This project, SocialNet API, tackles the challenge of building an API for a social network web application using MongoDB, Express.js, and Mongoose ODM. The aim is to handle large amounts of unstructured data typical in social networking platforms. The API enables users to share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage friend lists.

## User Story

As a social media startup, I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Server starts and Mongoose models sync to MongoDB database.
- GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts display formatted JSON data.
- POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts.
- POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.
